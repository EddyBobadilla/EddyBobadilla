- 👋 Hi, I’m @EddyBobadilla
- 👀 I’m interested in modern web development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: React, Sass, and Bootstrap, while always trying to get better at the fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS). In the near future I want to begin learning either Ruby or Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any web based projects that will challenge me to be a better web developer. 
- 📫 How to reach me: EddyBobadilla.com | EddyBobadilla91@Gmail.com | and here on GitHub :)
